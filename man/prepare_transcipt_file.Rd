\title{Prepare Transcript FASTA File for Analysis}
\usage{
prepare_transcipt_file(transcript_fa = NULL, output_path = "./")
}
\arguments{
\item{transcript_fa}{Path to the input FASTA file containing transcript sequences.
The sequence headers must contain transcript IDs and gene symbols.}

\item{output_path}{Path to the directory where the modified FASTA file will be saved.
The default is the current working directory (\code{"./"}).}
}
\value{
The function writes a modified FASTA file called \code{transcript.fa} in the
specified \code{output_path}. This file contains sequences with updated headers
combining transcript IDs and gene symbols. Returns nothing to the R environment.
}
\description{
This function processes a transcript FASTA file by renaming the sequence headers
with a combination of transcript IDs and gene symbols for downstream analysis.
The modified FASTA file is generated as output and can be used in workflows such as
ribosome profiling or RNA-seq analysis.
}
\details{
This function reads a transcript FASTA file, extracts transcript IDs and gene symbols
from the sequence headers, and renames the headers in the format \code{transcriptID|geneSymbol}.
The resulting FASTA file (\code{transcript.fa}) is saved for downstream analysis.
}
