\title{Create a Sequence Logo from Foreground and Background Sequences}
\usage{
logo_plot(
  foreground_seqs = NULL,
  background_seqs = NULL,
  rev_stack_order = FALSE,
  type = c("merge", "sep"),
  col_scheme = "chemistry2",
  method = c("bits", "prob", "EDLogo", "enrich")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{foreground_seqs}{A character vector of aligned amino acid sequences (e.g., all 15-mers).}

\item{background_seqs}{An optional character vector of background amino acid sequences.
Required if method = "enrich".}

\item{rev_stack_order}{Logical; whether to reverse the stacking of residues in the logo.}

\item{type}{Character. Choose between \code{"merge"} (combined enriched and depleted in one plot) or \code{"sep"} (two-panel for enriched/depleted). Default is "merge".}

\item{col_scheme}{Residue color scheme passed to \code{ggseqlogo}; default is \code{"chemistry2"}.}

\item{method}{Character; the logo type to use. One of \code{"bits"}, \code{"prob"}, \code{"EDLogo"}, or \code{"enrich"}.
See Details for explanation.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the sequence logo.
}
\description{
This function generates a sequence logo visualization using different methods, including:
bits-based, probability-based, EDLogo, and enrichment logo (custom log2-ratio based).
For enrichment logo, both foreground and background amino acid sequences are required.
}
\details{
\describe{
\item{"bits"}{Standard information-theory based sequence logo (Shannon bits).}
\item{"prob"}{Probability-based logo using relative residue frequencies.}
\item{"EDLogo"}{Enhanced difference logo from the Logolas package.}
\item{"enrich"}{Log2 enrichment-based logo:
Computes log2 fold-change of normalized residue frequencies between foreground and background.}}

When method = "enrich", both foreground_seqs and background_seqs must be of equal length.
Internally uses Biostrings::consensusMatrix() for frequency matrix generation.
