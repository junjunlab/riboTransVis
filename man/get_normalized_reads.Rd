\title{Get Normalized Read Counts (TPM and Translation Efficiency)}
\usage{
get_normalized_reads(object, ...)

\S4method{get_normalized_reads}{ribotrans}(object, type = c("rna", "ribo", "te"))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{ribotrans} object containing read counts and annotation metadata.
The \code{@counts} slot must be filled beforehand using \code{get_counts()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}

\item{type}{Character vector specifying which metrics to calculate. Acceptable values are:

\describe{
\item{\code{"rna"}}{Calculate RNA-seq TPM values}
\item{\code{"ribo"}}{Calculate Ribo-seq TPM values}
\item{\code{"te"}}{Calculate translation efficiency (TE = Ribo TPM / RNA TPM)}
}}
}
\value{
A named list with three elements, depending on the selected \code{type}:
\describe{
\item{\code{tpm.rna}}{Data frame of RNA TPM values and gene annotations (if \code{"rna"} is selected)}
\item{\code{tpm.ribo}}{Data frame of Ribo TPM values and gene annotations (if \code{"ribo"} is selected)}
\item{\code{te}}{Data frame of translation efficiency and gene annotations (if \code{"te"} is selected)}
}
}
\description{
Computes normalized gene expression levels from RNA-seq and/or Ribo-seq count data
stored in a \code{ribotrans} object. TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values are calculated
for both RNA and Ribo libraries. Additionally, translation efficiency (TE) is computed
as the ratio between Ribo-seq and RNA-seq TPM values.
}
\details{
TPM values are calculated using gene lengths (in kilobases) extracted from the \code{annotation}
component of the counts. TE is only computed for genes that are shared between both RNA and Ribo counts.
All outputs include gene annotations such as \code{gene_name} and \code{gene_biotype}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume `obj` is a ribotrans object with counts generated via get_counts()

# Get both RNA and Ribo TPM
normalized_list <- get_normalized_reads(obj, type = c("rna", "ribo"))

head(normalized_list$tpm.rna)
head(normalized_list$tpm.ribo)

# Compute translation efficiency (requires both RNA and Ribo counts)
te_list <- get_normalized_reads(obj, type = "te")
head(te_list$te)
}
