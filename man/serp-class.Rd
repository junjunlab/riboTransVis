\title{SERP (Selective Ribosome Profiling) Class}
\description{
An S4 class for representing and analyzing Selective Ribosome Profiling data.
The class extends the 'ribotrans' class and provides specific slots for storing
total occupancy, IP occupancy, and enriched ratio data.
}
\details{
The SERP class is designed for analyzing selective ribosome profiling experiments,
which typically involve comparing IP-enriched ribosome footprints with total ribosome footprints.
This class inherits all slots from the 'ribotrans' class and adds specific slots for
storing and analyzing the enrichment patterns.

\item{\code{total_occupancy}}{A data frame containing ribosome occupancy data from total samples.}

\item{\code{ip_occupancy}}{A data frame containing ribosome occupancy data from IP (immunoprecipitation) samples.}

\item{\code{enriched_ratio}}{A data frame containing the calculated enrichment ratios between IP and total samples.}
