\item{object}{A RiboSeq object containing ribosome profiling data with
summary_info and features slots}

\item{sample_selected}{Character vector. Names of samples to include in the
analysis. If NULL (default), all samples will be processed}

the mean of normalized values within sample groups. Default is FALSE}

to account for ribosome A-site positioning. Default is FALSE}

when offset correction is applied. Only used when do_offset_correct = TRUE.

exclude from the start and end of coding sequences.
Default is c(0,0)}

\description{
This function identifies ribosome pausing sites by calculating pause scores
based on the PausePred algorithm. It processes ribosome profiling data to
detect positions where ribosomes pause during translation elongation.
}
\details{
The function implements the PausePred algorithm for identifying ribosome pausing
sites with the following steps:

\enumerate{
\item \strong{Data preprocessing}: Applies optional offset correction and filters
samples and genomic regions based on user specifications
\item \strong{Normalization}: Calculates normalized ribosome density by dividing
read counts by the average count per position for each gene
\item \strong{Quality filtering}: Excludes genes with low total read counts
(< min_counts) to ensure reliable statistical inference
\item \strong{Window-based scoring}: For each position, calculates sums in two
overlapping windows and computes pause scores using the formula:
\deqn{pause\_score = \frac{window}{2} \times normsm \times \frac{sum_1 + sum_2}{sum_1 \times sum_2}}
\item \strong{Quality metrics}: Adds balance and imbalance ratio metrics for
downstream quality control and filtering
}

The pause score reflects the likelihood that a given position represents a
genuine pausing site, with higher scores indicating stronger evidence for
ribosome pausing. The algorithm is designed to identify positions where
ribosome density is elevated relative to neighboring regions.

\strong{Window Strategy:}
\itemize{
\item Window 1: position, position + window - captures downstream density
\item Window 2: position + window/2, position + 1.5*window - overlapping window
\item The overlapping design helps distinguish genuine pauses from noise
}

\strong{Quality Control Metrics:}
\itemize{
\item \code{balance_score}: Ranges from 0 to 0.5, with higher values indicating
more balanced window sums (recommended threshold: > 0.1-0.2)
\item \code{imbalance_ratio}: Ratio of larger to smaller window sum
(recommended threshold: < 5-10)
}
}
\section{Filtering Recommendations}{

For downstream analysis, consider filtering pause sites based on:
\itemize{
\item Pause score threshold (typically 10-20 for initial screening)
\item Balance score > 0.15 to exclude sites with extremely unbalanced windows
\item Imbalance ratio < 5 to remove artifacts from coverage imbalances
\item Minimum total coverage to ensure statistical reliability
}
}
